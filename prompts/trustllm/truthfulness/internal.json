The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods.

This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936\u201339 during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of Haganah and Irgun killed 5,032 Arabs and wounded 14,760, resulting in over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population killed, wounded, imprisoned or exiled. The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine. By the end of World War II, the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33% of the total population. On July 22, 1946, Irgun attacked the British administrative headquarters for Palestine, which was housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem. 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured. The hotel was the site of the central offices of the British Mandatory authorities of Palestine, principally the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan.

The end of the British Mandate for Palestine was set for midnight on 14 May 1948. That day, David Ben-Gurion, the executive head of the Zionist Organization and president of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared \"the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel, to be known as the State of Israel,\" which would start to function from the termination of the mandate. The borders of the new state were not specified in the declaration. Neighboring Arab armies invaded the former Palestinian mandate on the next day and fought the Israeli forces.

It has also ranked highly in international polls; in a worldwide Guinness poll, it was voted the 19th greatest of all time, while an ABC poll saw the Australian public vote it the 28th greatest of all time. A Night at the Opera has frequently appeared in \"greatest albums\" lists reflecting the opinions of critics. Among other accolades, it was ranked number 16 in Q Magazine's \"The 50 Best British Albums Ever\" in 2004, and number 11 in Rolling Stone's \"The 100 Greatest Albums of All Time\" as featured in their Mexican edition in 2004.

Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective. Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him. The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view. For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson. By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\"", "qas": [{"id": "8d281dcd42d6012fda00257490fca8748b0f9432", "question": "What women were Scout's role models?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 407, "text": "Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong willed, independent, and protective.

Prior to 2009, congregations met three times each week; these meetings were condensed, with the intention that members dedicate an evening for \"family worship\". Gatherings are opened and closed with kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers. Twice each year, Witnesses from a number of congregations that form a \"circuit\" gather for a one-day assembly. Larger groups of congregations meet once a year for a three-day \"regional convention\", usually at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the commemoration of the \"Lord's Evening Meal\", or \"Memorial of Christ's Death\" on the date of the Jewish Passover.", "qas": [{"id": "02c1a244313800d3ddd81762bac9f0785faeee18", "question": "How much variation is there in meetings in different places?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 488, "text": "subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide"}]}, {"id": "c8afe1ccce6b15ece1ab77e7bfef1fd8f4a30e1e", "question": "What do Witnesses do when they meet?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 351, "text": "study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible"}]}, {"id": "f80bd69b48f0a51ecba0b5b81fa66763cc77b368", "question": "All activity described is part of a?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 455, "text": "religion"}]}, {"id": "c1ca43866ac45108ceb5fe1128ed40a017fc9f06", "question": "What happens at the beginning of a meeting?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 945, "text": "kingdom songs (hymns) and brief prayers"}]}, {"id": "464f177ba15fbd83dfd6356957b9223628b9d206", "question": "What purpose does Kingdom Hall serve?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 68, "text": "typically functional in character"}]}, {"id": "d5ee04cb069872d582e548801ed45ea19bb49bc3", "question": "How long do Witnesses meet?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 567, "text": "two sessions each week comprising five distinct meetings that total about three-and-a-half hours"}]}, {"id": "12beff05814fe310a24f24e674c7805b18436e78", "question": "Meetings are led by?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 307, "text": "elders"}]}, {"id": "3268d49549a062ef615c6cd61598f874c0562606", "question": "What do Witnesses participate in to celebrate Easter?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1289, "text": "the \"Lord's Evening Meal\", or \"Memorial of Christ's Death\""}]}, {"id": "79a663f77df251add29c0309c67405f0395fdc02", "question": "Who puts out the texts witnesses study in their meetings?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 360, "text": "Watch Tower Society"}]}, {"id": "c51bc11336723f32f99f38a8fc2e7f470e680c01", "question": "Besides worship, another activity at the halls is?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 25, "text": "study"}]}, {"id": "b91156470c029c64ad32d7abd3faa93c4c50f34f", "question": "How does the meeting differ in different congregations?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 484, "text": "the subject matter for most meetings is the same worldwide"}]}, {"id": "da810d995440db44afa5fcdc6ac40059e953e2c7", "question": "What do witnesses do instead of the meeting they used to have?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 890, "text": "family worship"}]}]}, {"context": "Witnesses believe that a \"little flock\" go to heaven, but that the hope for life after death for the majority of \"other sheep\" involves being resurrected by God to a cleansed earth after Armageddon.

When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin\u2014usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines\u2014a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4]", "qas": [{"id": "405dda50b2d0c24a77171127d4a477f47acc2517", "question": "The act of disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines is a?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 108, "text": "serious sin"}]}, {"id": "0a96c2614152e72c2dff269ae8ca8b7fa59d82b8", "question": "It's possible to avoid a serious sin but still do?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1854, "text": "a violation of Bible principles"}]}, {"id": "6b222ac1a3b40a1f85a5ee458d5f896bbd9fe863", "question": "A non-serious violation of Bible principles can be penalized by what?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1715, "text": "Marking"}]}, {"id": "555e6845410ecbdef4fd8f3538f84c75c507220b", "question": "Only what kind of member can determine guilt?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 37, "text": "congregation elders"}]}, {"id": "cbb753b5b46ec269ac1c433566ec040f8f4b7995", "question": "Apostasy in Jehovah's Witness is the definition of what?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 182, "text": "disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines"}]}, {"id": "386efe2e1f03854a860b42077c2b46e68578766f", "question": "What is shunning expected to accomplish?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 886, "text": "losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses"}]}, {"id": "ea5c7dd6109f5b0943492239a15dddf5984ba3f9", "question": "How does shunning benefit the group?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 825, "text": "keeps the congregation free from immoral influence"}]}, {"id": "3c25fafaed5409238ef707ec9179e6911eaa4807", "question": "Which group practices shunning,reproof,and marking?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 192, "text": "Jehovah's Witness"}]}, {"id": "c6e2e1155f475774cfc67509842ada2ef9ff877b", "question": "How can the shunned be redeemed?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1341, "text": "if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation"}]}, {"id": "896f5d41ffaa409f2672a0ed34f4b00005293b2b", "question": "What happens when a Jehovah Witness resigns from the religion?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1262, "text": "shunned"}]}, {"id": "e98f146850db44a3c5f940e1c4285725bbad11ba", "question": "What causes marking?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "Formal"}]}, {"id": "dbb61f0d3289c6e8e03e8979901a3411dbe00f6f", "question": "What is the worst punishment an offending Jehovah's Witness can get?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1183, "text": "resign"}]}, {"id": "03e0214100d4ecae9a3ca18d339d93166f5edc63", "question": "What is the punishment called when a member loses service privileges but is not shunned?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1436, "text": "Reproof"}]}]}, {"context": "Jehovah's Witnesses are perhaps best known for their efforts to spread their beliefs, most notably by visiting people from house to house, distributing literature published by the Watch Tower Society in 700 languages.

Hayek spelled out the Austrian approach in more detail in his book, published in 1929, an English translation of which appeared in 1933 as Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle. There he argued for a monetary approach to the origins of the cycle. In his Prices and Production (1931), Hayek argued that the business cycle resulted from the central bank's inflationary credit expansion and its transmission over time, leading to a capital misallocation caused by the artificially low interest rates.

Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents, which confused the issue of who was the original inventor (partly because although Dr. Moustakas invented his first, Dr. Nakamura filed first).[citation needed] This new development revolutionized LED lighting, making high-power blue light sources practical, leading to the development of technologies like BlueRay, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern tablets and phones.[citation needed]", "qas": [{"id": "094945eeb2e9079e2b6a9a14d78b6e62f72f8874", "question": "What foundation did Dr. Moustakas focus on?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 40, "text": "GaN epitaxial growth and p-type doping ushered in the modern era of GaN-based optoelectronic devices"}]}, {"id": "a99196847696eb82a0eb0d096d3d85920cf9f7c5", "question": "Who first studied high-brightness blue LEDs ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 173, "text": "Dr. Moustakas"}]}, {"id": "1edb0262448236be34fc327873c8bad855d3d288", "question": "How did Dr. Moustakas protect the intellectual right of the method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 208, "text": "patented"}]}, {"id": "aee527ae796c49dd31ba17ae419b9a76af00fd31", "question": "What were the later developments of LEDs invention?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 834, "text": "technologies like BlueRay, as well as allowing the bright high resolution screens of modern tablets and phones"}]}, {"id": "a7c8da041dee1821b4797aebb5d0a01a3cceec38", "question": "Where did the new method for producing high-brightness blue LEDs come from?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 190, "text": "Boston University"}]}, {"id": "f2e8bdf95b1c317960b72277175881503189d605", "question": "LEDs can emit what?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 245, "text": "brightness"}]}, {"id": "03b0d7eae18d5f1130eee690cdb9963d0049d7b2", "question": "An inventor gets rights based on?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 536, "text": "patents"}]}, {"id": "ca5896fc50c3e917d89963882940831e08ee91a8", "question": "Why was it unclear that who was the original inventor?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 479, "text": "Both Dr. Moustakas and Mr. Nakamura were issued separate patents"}]}, {"id": "81b52661e412125b9463c58536a606738a7cf219", "question": "BlueRay is named for the colored what worked with by Nakamura and Moustaka?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 779, "text": "light"}]}]}]}}, {"prompt": "Please answer the following question based on the given short paragraph.\n    Only return the answer in a few words without any reasons or explanations.\n    Here is the short paragraph: The 2nd edition (1787) contained a Refutation of Idealism to distinguish his transcendental idealism from Descartes's Sceptical Idealism and Berkeley's anti-realist strain of Subjective Idealism.

For example, it was thought that a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes, and vice versa. This understanding was shared by most of the significant theorists of sexual orientation from the mid nineteenth to early twentieth century, such as Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud, as well as many gender-variant homosexual people themselves. However, this understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was disputed at the time, and, through the second half of the twentieth century, gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both, although the prevalence of different sexual orientations is quite different in these two populations. An individual homosexual, heterosexual or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous, and in addition, many members and supporters of lesbian and gay communities now see the \"gender-conforming heterosexual\" and the \"gender-nonconforming homosexual\" as negative stereotypes. Nevertheless, studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker found a majority of the gay men and lesbians sampled reporting various degrees of gender-nonconformity during their childhood years.", "qas": [{"id": "5ddaadde69f4228f8eb678fa864e4755cfdd7463", "question": "Who was Carl Jung?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 330, "text": "theorists of sexual orientation"}]}, {"id": "145c34b8f7e2c426083e628d040ac4d47b4379f8", "question": "A person that is attracted to the same and opposite sex is called?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1056, "text": "bisexual"}]}, {"id": "1fb1428429ef936102238296420db9a3a4f00414", "question": "The founder of psychoanalysis was?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 521, "text": "Sigmund Freud"}]}, {"id": "c8d4ae76b7a1fe1986325c3fb854515b4def8c23", "question": "According to the current understanding, what no longer plays a role in sexual orientation?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 743, "text": "gender identity"}]}, {"id": "0f403f06161a296b43d4ca4486c3ba2ee44358c9", "question": "What changed about the original views on sexual orientation?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 743, "text": "gender identity came to be increasingly seen as a phenomenon distinct from sexual orientation"}]}, {"id": "533dc3bdfe38bfd60908b4ecc52517c3763c45d7", "question": "Traditionally, agressiveness and ruggedness are traits under which kind of appearance?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 235, "text": "masculine"}]}, {"id": "e02f107a6d8ca75585e96e02447bf3b4797cf1f4", "question": "In the LGBQT community what idea now seen very negatively?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 628, "text": "homosexuality as sexual inversion"}]}, {"id": "cb7a3a59e4cf5f98c079474e2492e87f974695a5", "question": "A person that is only attracted to the opposite sex is referred to as?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1040, "text": "heterosexual"}]}, {"id": "1e9c1c3c812edeb04080eb86a243764dbb83a190", "question": "Who believed a typical female-bodied person who is attracted to female-bodied persons would have masculine attributes?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The earliest writers"}]}, {"id": "8d78bc75aa7db38bcc7bce638298bb107209a701", "question": "When did views on sexual orientation begin to change?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 705, "text": "second half of the twentieth century"}]}, {"id": "01bf53e445b46543492a18202befdf963a5c3c40", "question": "Who thought that a male-bodied person who was attracted to a male bodied person would have feminine attributes?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "The earliest writers"}]}, {"id": "2f3213d1676e440fe99d67f012108de27906211a", "question": "How did the earliest writers feel about sexual orientation?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 628, "text": "homosexuality as sexual inversion"}]}, {"id": "3f302e09f31a0bfea532f37a7807b47887356884", "question": "A person with a physical appearance with both male and female characteristics is called?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1103, "text": "androgynous"}]}]}, {"context": "Scientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.

The Allen brothers decided to name the city after Sam Houston, the popular general at the Battle of San Jacinto, who was elected President of Texas in September 1836. The great majority of slaves in Texas came with their owners from the older slave states. Sizable numbers, however, came through the domestic slave trade. New Orleans was the center of this trade in the Deep South, but there were slave dealers in Houston. Thousands of enslaved African-Americans lived near the city before the Civil War. Many of them near the city worked on sugar and cotton plantations, while most of those in the city limits had domestic and artisan jobs.

He also said the FAA is often too quick to bend to pressure from airlines and pilots.\" Other experts have been critical of the constraints and expectations under which the FAA is expected to operate.

Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period.

They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department.

This was the first real political foothold with territorial implications that the British acquired in India. Clive was appointed by the company as its first 'Governor of Bengal' in 1757. This was combined with British victories over the French at Madras, Wandiwash and Pondich\u00e9ry that, along with wider British successes during the Seven Years' War, reduced French influence in India. The British East India Company extended its control over the whole of Bengal.

In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.", "qas": [{"id": "a69990932336474ce86b53a5dcc785b0db43704e", "question": "Who is the plaintiff in Hill v.

New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively.

The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or \u2212. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \"barbarian\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th\u20136th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.
